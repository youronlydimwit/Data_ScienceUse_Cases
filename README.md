# Data Science Use Cases

Welcome to my Data Science repository! This repository contains self-made projects, scripts, and SQL Queries showcasing my understanding and ability to answer case studies with a data science approach. I have categorized some concepts of practice into separate directories. Feel free to look around!

## Introduction

Hi Everyone! My name is Sang Putu, and I am a Data Science Enthusiast. I work as a Data Analyst (also with Data Scientist Responsibilities) in a Pharmaceutical Company. My work areas include Marketing Analytics, Market Research & Insights, Product Portfolio, and Supply Chain Management. I like to put my knowledge to good use and help people, so I made this repository. I will try to update this repo in my free time.

## Directories

### Classification

**Description:** This directory is aimed specifically to go through Classification attempts at several datasets. In the future, it could be moved to the Predictions directory.

#### Classification Projects
- (Breast Cancer)[github.com/youronlydimwit/Data_ScienceUse_Cases/Classification/Breast_Cancer_Wisconsin.ipynb]
- (Gender Prediction)[github.com/youronlydimwit/Data_ScienceUse_Cases/Classification/Gender_Prediction.ipynb]
- (HRD Survey)[github.com/youronlydimwit/Data_ScienceUse_Cases/Classification/HRD_Survey.ipynb]
- (Mushrooms Classification)[github.com/youronlydimwit/Data_ScienceUse_Cases/Classification/Mushrooms_Classification.ipynb]

### Clustering

**Description:** This directory is aimed specifically to go through Clustering attempts at several datasets. In the future, it could be moved to the Predictions directory.

#### Clustering Projects
- TBA

### Predictions

**Description:** This directory attempts to predict values or labels according to each dataset, by using Regressions, SVM, Random Forest, and other algorithms. Some need to go through Data Cleaning first and EDA, and some are already cleaned.

#### Predictions Projects
- (Student Scores)[github.com/youronlydimwit/Data_ScienceUse_Cases/Predictions/Linear Regression/Linear_Regression_Student_Scores.ipynb]
- Human Resources Data Case Study

### SQL

**Description:** This directory attempts to use SQL for making a database system and data querying with examples of DDL and DML. Most of the databases are dummy data built by myself, free to reproduce.

#### [SQL Projects](github.com/youronlydimwit/Data_ScienceUse_Cases/SQL)
- Bike Store - WIP
- Luxtoys - WIP

### Scripts

**Description:** This directory's usage is to act like a cloud for my python scripts to be loaded as modules, mostly for visualizations and/or dataframe processing.

### VBA

**Description:** With experience in using Microsoft Excel, some tasks are becoming tedious, and I have uploaded some VBA scripts to be loaded as Macros in your own devices.

#### VBA Projects
- Text Similarity
